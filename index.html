        <div>
            <p>We're a group of nomadic Jesus people traveling Aotearoa, and we love doing life together with the folks we meet. And everyone we encounter is searching. For hope, for meaning, for belonging — everyone desires those things. In this multi-day workshop we'll dive into what it means to love God, each other, and the world, and how the person of Jesus helps us do that. We'd love to have you with us.</p>
